Reflection - Assignment 3

For the most part this assignment was not as hard as the last one; the ActionListeners were relatively straightforward, and it was fun experimenting with the different MouseListeners. The most challenging part was keeping the center point of the window fixed when zooming in/out - I gave it my best shot, but no matter what I tried the offset of my window stayed fixed. I did manage to adjust the view’s offset so that whatever point was clicked would become the center; I also added a mouseDragged function so the user could scroll by dragging the map. I attempted to create an applet version; however, I ran into a couple of difficulties: 1) java security wouldn’t allow me to run the applet unless I made an exception; 2) there were many $ classes created when MapGUI.java was compiled, so I had to make a jar file; 3) even with all of this, I kept getting either a ClassNotFound error (when I formatted the html file as, code="MapGUI.class") or a plain grey box (code=MapGUI.class); 4) MapGUI.java wouldn’t run in Eclipse as a java applet either, despite the MapGUI class extending JApplet and the public void init(){} function being identical to the one in BullseyeGUI.java.
